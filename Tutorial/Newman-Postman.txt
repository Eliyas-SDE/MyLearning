Limitations of Postman:
======================

Step 1: Export the collections, global and environment variables into a common folder

Step 2: Open the command prompt form the folder location and run newman run SanityRequest.postman-collection.json -e Dev-env.json -g myGlobal.json -r htmlextra

Note: 
=====
1) If we're running throgh Jenkins by ouselves then complete folder location has to be mentioned for collection, env and global. eg., c:\users\eliyas\downloads\SanityRequest.postman-collection.json 
2) If sheduling through jenkins then Create a project item--> General---> Build---> Execute Windows Batch Command and give the local folder location
